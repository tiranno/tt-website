					<h3>Rushing</h3>
					<p>Rushing is a process where people can come and find out what our fraternity is all about and get to know the brothers. </br>
					Our rush typically consists of a series of interactive events over the first few weeks of a semester. This is the time for students who are interested in joining the Fraternity become familiar with our values and brothers, and for us to get to know you. The point of rush is to help you decide if Theta Tau is for you. You can participate in as many or as little rush events as you would like. At the end of rush, you will be asked to schedule an interview with us.</br>

					<h3>Pledging</h3>
					<p>Pledging is a process in which a carefully selected group of <a href="#tt-eligible">eligible</a> individuals must complete in order to become full members of the Fraternity. </br>
					To be selected, you must sign up for an interview during rush. The pleding process usually goes on for an entire semester. This is the time that the pledge class will become the honorable men of the Fraternity and learn the traditions of Theta Tau. The pledging process will require a good amount of time from your schedule.

						<h4><strong>What kind of fraternity is Theta Tau?</strong></h4>
						<p>Sigma Chapter of Theta Tau is a male-only professional engineering fraternity. The purpose of Theta Tau is to develop and maintain a high standard of professional interest among its members, and to unite them in a strong bond of fraternal fellowship. We separate ourselves from being a social fraternity in that we also encompass a professional, common goal. We hold many social events, such as Engineers' Ball, and involve ourselves in the community with service and many brothers hold campus leadership positions.</p>

						<h4><strong>How do I join Theta Tau?</strong></h4>
						<p>To join Theta Tau, attend our rush events held at the beginning of every Fall and Spring semester. Each potential member is chosen after being interviewed at the end of rush, and must complete the pledge process once given a bid (a bid is an invitation to pledge for Theta Tau).</p>

						<h4><strong>What is Rushing?</strong></h4>
						<p>Rushing is a process where people can come and find out what our fraternity is all about, meet the brothers, and sign up for interviews if they are interested in joining. Our rush typically consists of an informational event, time to mingle one-on-one with the brothers, and a social night.</p>

						<h4><strong>What is Pledging?</strong></h4>
						<p>Pledging is a process in which a carefully selected group of eligible individuals must complete in order to become members of the fraternity. To be selected, you must sign up for an interview during rush. The process usually lasts an entire semester, and is meant to teach the pledge group how to become solid members of the fraternity, and life-long brothers.</p>
